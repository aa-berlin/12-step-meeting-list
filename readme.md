12 Step Meeting List
====================

This plugin is designed to help 12 step programs (AA, NA, Al-Anon, etc) list their meetings. It standardizes addresses, and displays in a list or map.

The best way to install this plugin is via [its home page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/12-step-meeting-list/) in the WordPress Plugin Directory.

## Support

We have changed the venue used for obtaining support for TSML to our development site. By using GitHub Issues, you are able to attach screen caps, share more information 
with the developers, and reduce duplicate work in the case of validated bugs. This also helps us as it consolidates support and improves tracking of concerns our users have.

To create a new support ticket, please navigate to [here](https://github.com/code4recovery/12-step-meeting-list/issues) and click on `New issue`. Then select the type of ticket, and complete as much as possible of the information requested. This will help us respond quicker.
